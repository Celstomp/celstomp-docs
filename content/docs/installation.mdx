## Running Celstomp

### With Node.js (Recommended)

This method uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173`

**Building for production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # Preview the built output
```

### With Python

This method doesn't require Node.js installation.

**Linux / Mac (Terminal):**
```bash
./run-dev.command
```

**Windows:**
Double-click `run-dev.bat` in File Explorer, or run from command prompt:
```cmd
run-dev.bat
```

The Python server will start at `http://localhost:8000`

## Browser Compatibility

Celstomp works in all modern browsers:

- **Chrome**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support

Make sure your browser is up to date for the best experience.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see a "port already in use" error:

**For Vite (Node.js):**
Edit `vite.config.js` to change the port number.

**For Python:**
The `run-dev.command` or `run-dev.bat` scripts can be edited to use a different port.

### Permission Errors

**Linux / Mac:**
If `./run-dev.command` won't run, make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x run-dev.command
```

**Windows:**
Right-click `run-dev.bat` and select "Run as administrator" if you encounter permission issues.

### Dependencies Not Found

If `npm install` fails:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall
npm install
```

description: Master Celstomp's timeline for frame-by-frame animation
---

The timeline is Celstomp's core animation control system, designed for traditional frame-by-frame cel animation workflow.

## Timeline Overview

The timeline displays all frames in your animation as a grid of cells. Each cell represents a single frame (cel).

### Navigation

Move through frames using keyboard or timeline controls:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `E` | Next frame |
| `Q` or `W` | Previous frame |
| `Space` | Play/Pause animation |
| `Home` | Jump to first frame |
| `End` | Jump to last frame |

### Frame Grid

- Each cell shows a thumbnail of that frame
- The current frame is highlighted with a distinct border
- Click any cell to jump directly to that frame
- Timeline scrolls automatically to keep the current frame visible

## Frame Operations

### Adding Frames

Celstomp automatically manages frames based on your actions:

- **New empty frame**: Add after the current frame (right-click timeline)
- **Duplicate frame**: Copy current frame to the next position
- **Clear frame**: Erase all content from the current frame

### Deleting Frames

Delete individual frames or ranges:

1. Select frame(s) in the timeline (click or drag)
2. Press the `Delete` key to remove
3. Confirm deletion if prompted

## Playback Controls

### Playback Controls

- **Play/Pause**: `Space` or the timeline play button
- **Loop**: Toggle between single-play and loop mode
- **Speed**: Adjust the playback FPS (frames per second)

### Timeline Display

- **FPS counter**: Shows the current playback speed
- **Time display**: Shows the animation duration at the current FPS
- **Frame counter**: Current frame / Total frames

## Onion Skin Integration

The timeline works seamlessly with onion skin:

- The previous frame is ghosted when viewing the next frame
- The next frame is ghosted when viewing the previous frame
- Toggle onion skin with `O` key or the toolbar button

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `E` / `R` | Next frame |
| `Q` / `W` | Previous frame |
| `Delete` | Delete selected frame(s) |
| `O` | Toggle onion skin |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` | Undo frame operation |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` | Redo frame operation |

## Tips

- Use **autofill** to automatically fill empty frames with the previous frame content
- **Play snapped** option snaps playback to frame boundaries
- **Keep onion playing** and **keep transparency playing** control preview behavior during playback
- Set your target frame rate before starting for accurate timing

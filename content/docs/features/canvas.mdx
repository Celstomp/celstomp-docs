---

The canvas is your main drawing area in Celstomp. It's designed to be intuitive and flexible for traditional frame-by-frame animation.

## Aspect Ratio Configuration

Celstomp supports various canvas aspect ratios for different animation styles:

- **16:9** (default) - Widescreen format
- **4:3** - Traditional TV format
- **1:1** - Square format
- **Custom** - Set your own dimensions

You can change the aspect ratio in the canvas settings menu.

## Navigation

### Zoom and Pan

Navigate your canvas easily with multiple input methods:

**Mouse/Trackpad:**
- Scroll wheel to zoom in/out
- Hold middle mouse button and drag to pan
- Or use scroll wheel click (middle click) to pan

**Touch (Tablet/Mobile):**
- Pinch to zoom in/out
- Drag with two fingers to pan

### Reset View

Press `R` or use the reset button in the canvas toolbar to return to the default zoom and center position.

## Canvas Features

### Drawing Area

The drawing area displays your current frame with the active layer selected. Onion skin previews (if enabled) show ghosted versions of adjacent frames.

### Background

The PAPER layer serves as the background. Use it for:
- Static backgrounds
- Layout drawings
- Reference images
- Elements that stay constant across frames

## Performance Tips

- Use an appropriate canvas size for your intended output resolution
- Smaller canvases improve performance on older devices
- Consider the aspect ratio of your target platform (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.)
- For high-resolution export, work at a larger canvas size

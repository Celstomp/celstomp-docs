Celstomp supports exporting animations in multiple formats for different use cases.

## Export Formats

### MP4 Video

Export as MP4 video file:
- **Wide compatibility**: Plays on most devices and platforms
- **Compression**: Configurable quality settings
- **Best for**: YouTube, social media, presentations

**File extension**: `.mp4`

### GIF

Export as animated GIF:
- **Wide support**: Plays in browsers, messaging apps
- **Limited colors**: 256-color palette (may dither)
- **Best for**: Quick previews, memes, web use

**File extension**: `.gif`

### Image Sequence

Export as individual image files:
- **Maximum quality**: No compression artifacts
- **Full flexibility**: Edit in other software, composite manually
- **Best for**: Professional post-production, high-quality needs

**File extension**: `.png` (one file per frame)

## Export Settings

### Frame Rate (FPS)

Control animation speed:

| FPS | Use Case |
|-----|----------|
| 12 fps | Traditional animation timing |
| 24 fps | Film/TV standard |
| 30 fps | Smooth web animation |
| 60 fps | High frame-rate gaming |

### Quality (for MP4)

Adjust video quality:
- **Low**: Smaller file size, more compression
- **Medium**: Balanced size and quality
- **High**: Larger file, minimal compression

### Duration

Export specific frame ranges:
- **All frames**: Entire animation
- **Selection**: Only selected timeline frames
- Use multi-select (`Shift` + click) to specify range

## Exporting

1. **Open export menu**: File -> Export
2. **Choose format**: Select MP4, GIF, or Image Sequence
3. **Configure settings**: Set FPS, quality, and range
4. **Export**: Click export button
5. **Download**: File downloads automatically

## Project Files

Celstomp projects are saved as `.json` files containing:
- All frames and layers
- Canvas settings (size, aspect ratio)
- Palettes and color data
- Tool settings and preferences

### Saving Projects

**Keyboard**: `Ctrl/Cmd + S`

Project files save to browser default download location.

### Loading Projects

**Keyboard**: `Ctrl/Cmd + O`

1. Open file dialog
2. Select `.json` project file
3. Project loads with all data intact

### Auto-Save

Celstomp automatically saves draft projects:
- **Location**: Browser local storage
- **Restoration**: Available on next visit
- **Multiple drafts**: Recent projects shown on home screen

## Export Workflow Examples

### Social Media (GIF)

1. Create animation at appropriate dimensions
2. Set FPS to 12-24 for social media
3. Export as GIF
4. Upload directly to platforms

### YouTube (MP4)

1. Use recommended canvas size (1920×1080 or 1280×720)
2. Set FPS to 24 or 30
3. Export as MP4 at Medium or High quality
4. Upload to YouTube

### Post-Production (Image Sequence)

1. Export as PNG image sequence
2. Import into video editor (After Effects, Premiere, DaVinci)
3. Add effects, compositing, color grading
4. Render final video from editor

## Export Troubleshooting

### GIF looks bad

**Issue**: Dithering or color banding

**Solutions**:
- Use simpler color palette
- Reduce number of frames
- Consider MP4 export instead

### MP4 file too large

**Issue**: Export file size excessive

**Solutions**:
- Reduce quality setting
- Lower FPS
- Reduce canvas dimensions

### Can't export

**Issue**: Export button not working

**Solutions**:
- Check browser permissions (download access)
- Ensure frames exist in timeline
- Try different browser

## Tips

- **Test exports**: Preview before final export
- **Use appropriate format**: GIF for quick shares, MP4 for quality
- **Consider FPS**: Lower FPS for traditional look, higher for smooth motion
- **Keep backups**: Save project files before export
- **Batch exports**: Export multiple versions (GIF + MP4) for different uses

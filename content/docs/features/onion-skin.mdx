title: Onion Skin
description: Preview previous and next frames for smooth animation
---

Onion skin (also called onion skinning) lets you see previous and/or next frames as ghosted overlays while drawing the current frame. This is essential for smooth, traditional animation.

## What is Onion Skin?

Onion skin displays adjacent frames at reduced opacity over your current canvas:

- **Previous frame**: Shows frame before current
- **Next frame**: Shows frame after current
- **Ghosted display**: Appears semi-transparent
- **Real-time updates**: Updates as you draw

This technique originates from traditional animation where artists would stack translucent animation cels (sheets of onion-skin paper) to see motion.

## Enabling Onion Skin

Toggle onion skin visibility:

- **Keyboard**: Press `O`
- **Button**: Click onion skin icon in toolbar
- **Menu**: View -> Onion Skin

When enabled, ghosted frames appear on your canvas.

## Onion Skin Settings

### Color Tint

Apply color tints to ghosted frames for better visibility:

- **Previous frame color**: Choose tint color (default: customizable)
- **Next frame color**: Choose tint color (default: customizable)
- **Purpose**: Distinguish between prev/next and current frame

Common tints:
- Previous: Blue tint
- Next: Red tint
- Current: Normal (no tint)

### Opacity

Control how transparent ghosted frames appear:

- **Range**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully visible)
- **Default**: ~30-40% for subtle ghosting
- **Adjust**: Use opacity slider in settings

Higher opacity makes ghosted frames more visible but may clutter the view.

### Blend Mode

Choose how ghosted frames blend with current frame:

| Blend Mode | Effect | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Multiply** | Darkens, preserves highlights | Dark lineart |
| **Overlay** | Increases contrast | General animation |
| **Source Over** | Standard blending | Most common |

## Playback Options

Control onion skin during animation playback:

### Keep Onion Playing

Show onion skin during playback:
- **Enabled**: Ghosted frames visible while playing
- **Disabled**: Onion skin hidden during playback
- **Useful**: Verify smooth motion without distraction

### Keep Transparency Playing

Control layer transparency during playback:
- **Enabled**: Layer transparency states preserved
- **Disabled**: All layers shown at full opacity
- **Useful**: Preview final animation without onion ghosting

## Onion Skin Workflow

### Frame-to-Frame Animation

1. Draw initial frame
2. Enable onion skin to see previous frame
3. Draw next frame using previous as reference
4. Repeat for entire animation

### Inbetweening

Create smooth transitions between keyframes:
1. Draw keyframe A
2. Draw keyframe B
3. Create inbetween frames with both onion skins visible
4. Adjust timing and spacing using ghosted references

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `O` | Toggle onion skin visibility |
| `F` | Toggle transparency hold |
| Settings panel | Adjust color, opacity, blend mode |

## Tips

- **Use different tints** for previous vs next frames to distinguish them
- **Adjust opacity** based on your visual preference and drawing style
- **Toggle during playback** to verify motion flow
- **Keep previous frame** visible when drawing for smooth continuity
- **Hide next frame** when drawing to focus on relationship with previous frame only

## Common Issues

### Ghosted frames too distracting

**Solution**: Reduce opacity or use subtler tint colors.

### Can't tell which is current frame

**Solution**: Increase contrast between ghosted frames and current content.

### Onion skin in wrong place

**Solution**: Check frame ordering and ensure you're on the correct frame number.
